# PlanetWeightStimulator
# 🌍 Planetary Force Calculator
A very simple, very beginner friendly mini - project. 

Ever wondered how much you'd weigh on Mars? This interactive web app calculates gravitational force using Newton's second law (F = ma) for different planets. Just click a planet, enter your mass, and discover your weight across the solar system!

## Features

- Interactive planet selection with visual interface
- Fixed gravitational acceleration values for 8 celestial bodies
- Real-time force calculation using F = ma
- Responsive design with space theme
- No API keys required - pure physics calculations

## Planets Included

- **Earth**: 9.8 m/s²
- **Moon**: 1.62 m/s²
- **Mars**: 3.71 m/s²
- **Jupiter**: 24.79 m/s²
- **Venus**: 8.87 m/s²
- **Saturn**: 10.44 m/s²
- **Mercury**: 3.7 m/s²
- **Neptune**: 11.15 m/s²

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Flask app: `python app.py`
4. Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## How to Use

1. Click on any planet to select it
2. Enter mass in kilograms
3. Click "Calculate Force" to see the gravitational force in Newtons
4. The result shows F = ma calculation with the planet's gravity
